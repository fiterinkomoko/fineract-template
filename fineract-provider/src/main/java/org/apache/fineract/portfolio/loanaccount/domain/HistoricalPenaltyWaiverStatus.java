/**
 * Lifecycle of a historical penalty waiver.
 *
 * <p>
 * The ticket asks for Processing, Loan Reprocessed and Accounting Corrected as separate states. They all complete
 * inside one database transaction, so no reader can ever observe one without the next; they collapse into
 * {@link #PROCESSING}. Only the Odoo hand-off is genuinely asynchronous and therefore genuinely observable.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the same reason the ticket's Failed - Loan Processing and Failed - Accounting states do not exist here: a
 * failure in either rolls the whole transaction back, taking this row with it, so nothing survives to carry the
 * status. The operator re-submits instead. {@link #FAILED_ODOO_SYNC} is kept because the Odoo hand-off commits
 * separately and a persistent failure there does need to become visible.
 * </p>
